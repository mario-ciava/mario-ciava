# Hi, I'm Mario.

Welcome to my small corner of GitHub.

I'm not a "rockstar developer". I hold a master's degree in finance, but I've always had my hands deep in code, electronics and more recently, AI. I enjoy building things that work, learning by doing and showing my journey transparently, mistakes included.

Here you'll find my experiments: governance tools, data visualizations, bots and research prototypes.

### What I'm exploring right now

Here are some of the projects I care about most:

- **[Chipsy](https://github.com/mario-ciava/Chipsy)**: a Discord bot for playing Blackjack and Texas Hold'em. It was born for hobby servers: no real money, no real casino pretensions. Just a Node.js backend, a Vue control panel and some healthy state management.

- **[CFP (Convergent Flow Protocol)](https://github.com/mario-ciava/CFP)**: my blockchain research playground. It's a Python prototype exploring concepts like DAG sequencing, intent auctions and ZK provers. It's purely educational, but it's where I have fun diving into technical details.

- **[mariociavarella.it](https://mariociavarella.it)**: my personal site. Built with Astro and Tailwind, but above all, it's where I collect my "working notes". I like to document how my ideas evolve, not just the final result.

### My approach

I build to understand. I like taking apart complex problems and rebuilding them one piece at a time. My goal isn't perfect architecture, but transparent code that tells a story of learning and solves real problems.

If you see something that intrigues you or have an idea to discuss, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to have a chat.

Cheers,
Mario
